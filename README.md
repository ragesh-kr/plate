<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


There are many great POS softwares available in the market, however I did not see any small restaurant owners using the latest state of the art, cloud based solutions which aids them with analytics. Almost 80% of small to mid sized outlets relied on basic standalone applications. 

On a rough average a small outlet/restaurant/supermarket proprietor needs to visit all the outlets on a daily basis for bill closing and sales analysis. I wanted to build an application that would solve this issue without using any high end POS software. Hence PLATE , plate can read excel/csv/db and analyze the data.

Based on the discussions I had with various owners the key metric that they need are

1. Day On Day and Month on Month Sales comparison
2. Comparing sales on every friday, saturday and sunday across weeks and months

Apart from their regular metrics I have added few more like,

Overall sales Trend
1. Best performing and worst performing items based on sale
2. Comparing items based on their sale value
3. Cross sale, which items goes well with which item in a given category
4. Overall performance oof the outlet

Caveats:
* Its is configured to read a particular format for now, format generalization module is yet to be built
* As the project is in initial stage, there is no Mobile support
* I am concentreating on the back end, UI we are using opensource templates

Of course, all the above mentioned points will be covered soon
